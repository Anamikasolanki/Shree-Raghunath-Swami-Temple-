                                1000-900 years old Shri Raghunath Swami Temple, whose historical
                                footprints are according to popular belief, it is said that the
                                idol of this temple was not made by hands but was descended from
                                the ground.To understand the incident of incarnation of this idol,
                                we will have to go back hundreds of years. Presently this temple
                                is situated in Bhanpura tehsil of Mandsaur district. Yes, this is
                                the same Bhanpura which was the capital of Holkar dynasty.
                                Bhanpura was the capital of Holkar dynasty during the reign of
                                Maharaj Shri Yashwant Rao Holkar between 1811 and 1833.After his
                                death, Indore was made the capital by his successor. Today's
                                Bhanpura used to be in Indargarh 1000 to 900 years ago.Which was a
                                settlement located one kilometer away from present Bhanpura. There
                                used to be an ashram of a great ascetic sage near this settlement.
                                Whose food his disciples used to bring as alms from this colony.
                                But this alms used to come from only two family houses. This
                                family had two houses, one belonging to Rathore and one belonging
                                to Prajapati community. Only two handfuls of grains from each
                                house were used for food. One day when the same sage asked his
                                disciples the reason for getting less alms, the disciples told him
                                that they got alms from both the worlds. Hearing this, the sage
                                got angry and cursed that despite so many houses in the
                                settlement, only two houses were getting alms and ordered to
                                vacate the settlement.

                                divine power. The evidence of which is still buried hundreds of
                                feet deep in the ground even today. Which proves this
                                incident.there used to be a pond from where the idol descended,
                                which had dried up due to the curse and the people of the village
                                settled on the banks of this pond. In which those two families
                                were also included. Who used to give alms. And at that time by
                                Ghanavar Bhil when When digging for the construction of a hut,
                                during the digging, Bhil's tool collided with the stone of the
                                idol and got clogged but he could not remove that stone. That
                                night, a member of the same Rathore family named Raghunath
                                Rathore. He had a vision of Lord Vishnu in his dream and saw the
                                idol coming out and Talked about installing the statue. The next
                                day, Raghunath Rathore took out the idol which was made of black
                                and black stone. Along with the idol, two pots of gold were found.
                                In which one pitcher was kept below the installation site of the
                                idol and with the help of the other pitcher the temple was
                                constructed and with the passage of time the construction of this
                                temple has been going on. so temple construction The person who
                                established the temple came to know the idol by the name of Shri
                                Raghunath Rathore and the same temple is still being operated by
                                the Ghanavar Rathore Teli Samaj.

                                related to this miracle because the family generation of the
                                person associated with this incident is still present. This person
                                himself worshiped Shri Raghunath Swami. And every morning the Lord
                                used to give him a gold coin when he opened the door of the
                                temple. In 1956, when scarlet fever broke out, a famine-like
                                situation arose but this did not affect the priest's daily routine
                                due to which people accused the priest of theft. And due to fear
                                of complaint in the police station,he told people about the coin
                                given by Lord Shri Raghunath Swami, after that the priest stopped
                                getting the coin. The generation of priests still exists today.

                                Recently, when the restoration work of the temple was going on
                                under the guidance of the then president of Rathore society, Shri
                                Mangal Singh Ji Rathore and priest Shri Santosh Ji Sharma That's
                                why they got to see this miracle not once but twice or thrice.A
                                miracle in which when at around 3 o'clock in the night the
                                laborers wanted to drink tea, the shops were not open and tea was
                                not available even milk was not available at priest home also then
                                a cow without a calf was found to come there and keeping the head
                                of the cow in the lap of Mangal ji Rathod and after some time the
                                priest Shri Santosh ji taking out a tumbler of milk from the
                                breasts and the cow disappearing is a miracle of God. Meanwhile,
                                there was another incident in which around 10 to 20 laborers
                                working on the roof of the temple during the construction work of
                                the temple, after they got down, the roof collapsed and the lives
                                of the laborers were saved.After finding out the reason for the
                                incident, everyone was surprised; in that incident, the load of
                                the entire roof along with the weight of the workers was being
                                borne by just one pebble of the lantern and the roof collapsed
                                after the workers got down. This is nothing less than a
                                miracle.Therefore, many such miracles are performed by God every
                                moment. They are created somewhere and fulfill the wishes of the
                                devotee.
